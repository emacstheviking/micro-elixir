# Elixir Colouring

This is *rough* and *ready* and as always, feel free to hack it around and submit a PR.

It works for, get's me through the day.

And yes, we are very very lucky to use Elixir in the first place.

# Installation

Check this project out and then copy the elixir.yaml file into wherever your local operating
system can find it, for me on 18.04 LTS this is:

    $HOME/.config/micro/syntax

Next time you edit a file ending with ".exs" or ".ex" it should say "elixir" in the status bar.

Happy hacking.  :)
